<Title>Determine a user's timezone</Title>
<Body>&lt;p&gt;Is there a standard way for a web server to be able to determine a user&#x27;s timezone within a web page? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Perhaps from an HTTP header or part of the &lt;code&gt;user-agent&lt;/code&gt; string?&lt;/p&gt;</Body>

<answer>
<Body>&lt;p&gt;There are no HTTP headers that will report the clients timezone so far although it has been suggested to include it in the HTTP specification.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If it was me, I would probably try to fetch the timezone using clientside JavaScript and then submit it to the server using Ajax or something.&lt;/p&gt;</Body>

<Body>&lt;p&gt;JavaScript is the easiest way to get the client&#x27;s local time. I would suggest using an &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XMLHttpRequest&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;XMLHttpRequest&lt;/a&gt; to send back the local time, and if that fails, fall back to the timezone detected based on their IP address.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As far as geolocation, I&#x27;ve used &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.maxmind.com/app/ip-location&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;MaxMind GeoIP&lt;/a&gt; on several projects and it works well, though I&#x27;m not sure if they provide timezone data. It&#x27;s a service you pay for and they provide monthly updates to your database. They provide wrappers in several web languages.&lt;/p&gt;</Body>
