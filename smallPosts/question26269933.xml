<Title>How to make a file chooser that preserve as an object some data?</Title>
<Body>&lt;p&gt;I would like to read a .txt file and then apply some pre-processing with scikit-learn, for example assume that i want to vectorize (i.e. make a vector representation from some text) some text i tried with this script but i canÂ´t apply such pre-processing to the selected file(.txt), which is in the desktop.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is what i done:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;# -- coding: utf-8 --from Tkinter import Tkfrom tkFileDialog import askopenfilenamefrom sklearn.feature_extraction.text import CountVectorizervectorizer= CountVectorizer(min_df=1)Tk().withdrawopinion_filename = askopenfilename()opinion_filename = askopenfilename()if opinion_filename:    with open(opinion_filename) as opinion_file:        X = vectorizer.fit_transform(opinion_file)        print(&quot;This is the name of the filename:&quot;,opinion_filename)        print (&quot;This is the vectorized filename &quot;,X)else:   # user might select no file and hit cancel the file open dialog   pass&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is the output:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;(&#x27;This is the name of the filename:&#x27;, &#x27;/Users/user/Desktop/opinion_prueba.txt&#x27;)(&#x27;This is the vectorized filename &#x27;, &amp;lt;1x22 sparse matrix of type &#x27;&amp;lt;type &#x27;numpy.int64&#x27;&amp;gt;&#x27;    with 22 stored elements in Compressed Sparse Row format&amp;gt;)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;I would like to return the vector representation of the .txt file.&lt;/p&gt;</Body>

<Body>&lt;p&gt;The method &lt;code&gt;askopenfilename&lt;/code&gt; returns the name of the file (as a string), not a file object that you could read data from. So you need to update your code to open a file object from the file name, and then pass that file object to &lt;code&gt;vectorizer.fit_transform&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;opinion_filename = askopenfilename()if opinion_filename:    with open(opinion_filename) as opinion_file:        X = vectorizer.fit_transform(opinion_file)        # rest of the code ...else:   # user might select no file and hit cancel the file open dialog   pass&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;</Body>
