<Title>DEVSimPy vs Simpy</Title>
<Body>&lt;p&gt;I&#x27;m currently on the search for differences in simulation software for python. Most hits from a search of google scholar that are comparisons of simulation software only mention DEVSimPy. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So my question is: are DEVSimPy and Simpy the same?&lt;/p&gt;</Body>

<answer>
<Body>&lt;p&gt;DEVSimPy has nothing to do with SimPy and I do not know why they are using such a similar name.&lt;/p&gt;</Body>
