<Title>June 2018 Visual Studio Code: C++ Compile Failure</Title>
<Body>&lt;p&gt;I submitted a previous question (see: &lt;a href=&quot;https://stackoverflow.com/questions/51229345/visual-studio-c-code-a-exe&quot;&gt;Visual Studio Code...&lt;/a&gt;) and have since struggled through with various checks / changes / uninstall / reinstalls. None of which are working.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I had just started running VS Code (pre-June 2018 version) and using it as my editor (defacto &quot;IDE&quot;) for C++, and it was generating *.exe files....all perfectly according to the cookbook recipes for installation.Then, the June 2018 version was installed as an update.&lt;br&gt;And, to clean up my platform, which had another (and possibly conflicting) installation of MinGW that I was oblivious to when I started running C++ with the suggested download/installation of MinGW.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, despite cleanup of the Uninstalled conflicts (I consulted the vendor of the software for advice) &amp;amp; cleaning of the System PATH and so forth, I am &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;still&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; getting the message noted by another question (see link at: &lt;a href=&quot;https://stackoverflow.com/questions/47872250/cant-compile-code-launch-program-program-path-does-not-exist&quot;&gt;&#x27;program does not exist&quot;&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Normally, the Stackoverflow routine would be to add a &lt;strong&gt;Comment&lt;/strong&gt; to the thread (URL above), but as I have yet to reach a reputation score of 1500 pts, I cannot make comments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Given the number of problems with VSCode &amp;amp; C++ compilation (&gt;&gt;not spitting out a.exe files), there seems to be some sort of systematic problem. If someone out there has a 1500+ Reputation score, would you please create a new tag: Visual Studio Code June 2018 ??&lt;/p&gt;</Body>
