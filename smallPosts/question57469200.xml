<Title>How to count how much times different methods of the imported class were executed?</Title>
<Body>&lt;p&gt;I want to count imported class&#x27; methods executions while script running. And stop the script according the method executions limit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I tried to use the &lt;code&gt;__getattribute__&lt;/code&gt; to count executions in inherited class, but it is too hard to use it for such a simple problem (at least at first glance).&lt;/p&gt;</Body>
