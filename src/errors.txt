I have also found not tiding up after using certain objects like pens can cause the issue.</p>\n\n<p>I personally have suffered Out of Memory Exceptions which can be caused but are not exclusive to memory leaks in dot net applications. (OOM can also come from pinning see <a href=\"https://blogs.msdn.com/yunjin/archive/2004/01/27/63642.aspx\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Pinning Artical</a>). If you are not getting OOM errors or need to confirm if it is a memory leak causing it then the only way is to profile your application.</p>\n\n<p>I would also try and ensure the following:</p>\n\n<p>a) Everything that implements Idisposable is disposed either using a finally block or the using statement these include brushes, pens etc.(some people argue to set everything to nothing in addition) </p>\n\n<p>b)Anything that has a close method is closed again using finally or the using statement (although I have found using does not always close depending if you declared the object outside the using statement)</p>\n\n<p>c)If you are using unmanaged code/windows API's that these are dealt with correctly after. (some have clean up methods to release resources)</p>\n\n<p>Hope this helps.</p>\n", "OwnerUserId": "33", "LastActivityDate": "2008-08-01T17:57:14.117", "CommentCount": "0"}
